# `CC Crypto based on Moralis ethereum-boilerplate`

> All-in-one crypto website

ðŸš€DEMO: https://ethereum-boilerplate.github.io/ethereum-boilerplate

This boilerplate is built on [react-moralis](https://github.com/MoralisWeb3/react-moralis) and [Moralis](https://moralis.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ethereum-boilerplate). Also has its own context provider for quick access to chainId or ethAddress

There are many components in this boilerplate that do not require an active web3 provider, they use Moralis Web3 API. Moralis supports the most popular blockchains and their test networks.
